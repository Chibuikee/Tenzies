# Tenzies
Game originally created by Bob ziroll in a [scrimba React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). I have added some features, 
such as adding and displaying the players name.
my name will be displayed at the end of the game for the next one week as a way of celebrating my achievement of disgesting and finishing the course. 
later versions will allow users to add their name, track how many times the rolled the dice, minutes spent on completing the challenge,
store and view history. more congratulatory messages, etc. 
You could suggest more features by tweeting at [reactfbox](https://twitter.com/reactfbox). 
Many thanks to [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll) for this wonderful course.
